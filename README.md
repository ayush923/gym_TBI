here i have created a gym website using HTML and CSS . There are a total of 4 pages 1- home page 2- about page 3- services 4- is the contact page in which various ways to connect to the gym is situated. And there is an index page for the first time login to the website.
user can toggle between these tabs using navigation bar where all the options to different pages is located .
For better understanding look into the comments embedded between the codes.
Thankyou
